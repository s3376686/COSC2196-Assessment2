                        IT Delivery Lead</a>
                </p2><br>

                <br><br>
                <p2>• Description:</p2><br>
                <p3>The term Agile describes a management methodology which is commonly used with software development,
                    as the software can contain multiple pipelines and projects being worked on by different team
                    members and it can be challenging to monitor the various aspects of a project with regards to
                    efficiency and expenditure. An Agile delivery lead, therefore, provides leadership and works within
                    the team to help report and deliver the project to stakeholders. It's appeal to me is that it can be
                    a very multi-faceted role that requires knowledge and experience of not only all of the phases of a
                    project build but excellent problem solving, leadership and management skills to motivate and guide
                    a team along with communication skills to report to executives or stakeholders who may not be as
                    well versed on typical software development metrics.<br><br>

                    <p2>• Skills, qualifications and experience required for the position:</p2><br>
                    I feel like this position would first require a full understanding of Agile development and
                    principles, strong organisational skills to facilitate meetings and presentations, communication
                    skills to work within a team environment and report to the various project stakeholders, and strong
                    analytical and problem-solving skills to assist in resolving issues and reducing risk. There would
                    also be the experience in dealing with flexible and scalable outcomes to deliver on the various key
                    metrics.<br><br>

                    <p2>• Skills, qualifications and experience I currently have:</p2><br>
                    I have dedicated team and leadership skills with experience in operations management which typically
                    involves collaboration and monitoring daily to deliver on business KPIs (Key Performance
                    Indicators). Working within a team also mirrors the dynamics required to be able to deal with risks,
                    tasks, issues and to action items accordingly. I have the communication skills required to interact
                    with software developers about the technological intricacies within the project as well as be able
                    to deliver outcomes to stakeholders who would require different information on deliverables. I also
                    have experience dealing with risk management, problem solving and dealing with transformational
                    change.<br><br>

                    <p2>• How I will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position:</p2>
                    <br>
                    I believe the best way to obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position
                    would be to be involved in Agile projects in any capacity to be more versed in the environment and
                    demonstrate a deep understanding of the processes, skills, pipelines, and infrastructure used to
                    build and deliver software.<br><br>
