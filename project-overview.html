				<h2>Project Idea</h2>
				<h3>Summary</h3>
				<p>Email phishing attacks (baiting an unsuspecting computer user and hoping that they will bite) are
					some of the most frequent and dangerous online threats that target individuals and businesses these
					days.</p>
				<p>Often being social engineering attacks, phishing emails can be cleverly crafted to appear completely
					benign technically to both user and antimalware scanner but tricking an email recipient into
					clicking
					on a malicious site that looks legitimate or download a document that hides malware.</p>
				<p><b>PhishNet</b> is a phishing email analysis and open intelligence system designed to expedite email
					triage and analysis process as well as threat intelligence sharing.</p>
				<h3>Challenges and Motivation</h3>
				<p>Adversaries continuously invent new and creative ways to fool users into believing their actions
					involve a legitimate website or email by forging websites to appear identical to the real sites.
					<br>Combating ongoing and ever evolving phishing email threats typically requires a team of cyber
					security analysists, end user education, expensive email scanner platforms and malware sandboxes.
				</p>
				<p>Our team, Agile-Expensibles, believes we can help small businesses and individuals fight against
					fraud
					and phishing emails avoiding costly enterprise solutions, enriching community threat intelligence as
					well as being an open system providing and consuming external system APIs.</p>

				<p>Three methods that can reduce incidents from occurring due to phishing attacks are:
				<ol>
					<li>Detect and prevent phishing attacks from reaching recipient</li>
					<li>Detect and prevent after the user has been tricked into opening a site URL or attachment</li>
					<li>User education and tooling into identifying potential threats</li>
				</ol>
				While all three above solutions are important to consider in combating phishing threats, User education
				and tooling is the most important method should the defences fail to prevent an attack
				programmatically.
				</p>

				<p>In a typical environment, an investment is made into some form of a solution that attempts at
					blocking a malicious email by means of:
				<ul>
					<li>Link scanning</li>
					<li>Attachment scanning for viruses</li>
					<li>Finding keywords identifying spam and phishing</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p>But is this enough to safeguard users? Not always. Security controls can fail, links can be cleverly
					obfuscated or be hosted on legitimate websites with good reputation but were compromised,
					malicious documents can be crafted to bypass antivirus detection.</p>

				<h4>Identifying the market</h4>
				<p>Now that the gap has been identified and demonstrated in above infographic, we present a solution
					aiming at addressing the specific problems of malicious emails getting through security controls
					which are to involve a user making an informed decision.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="column medium-6 large-6">
				<p>What are the project objectives:
				<ul>
					<li>Facilitate email analysis and context to help make better informed decisions when investigating
						emails</li>
					<li>Integration with other security solutions to automate or at least augment phishing threat
						response</li>
					<li>Valuable up to date phishing threat intelligence shared across users and automatic
						classification of email senders, links and attachments based on currently shared indicators.
					</li>
					<li>Consequently, because of using the platform, user becomes educated in understanding email
						technology and associated threats.</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="column medium-6 large-6">
				<p>What the project is not intended to do:
				<ul>
					<li>Detect and Prevent phishing emails from reaching recipients.<br>There are several mature
						commercial (Microsoft Defender, Forcepoint Email Gateways) and open-source solutions (i.e.
						CLamAV, SpamAssassin)
						<br>However, it is not possible to prevent a proportion of phishing emails today with ever
						evolving techniques from adversaries.
						<br>This means only the big market players with enough human resource and budget capacity can
						provide some form of protection in terms of evolving threat detection rules and intelligence.
					</li>
					<li>Contain or remediate phishing email incidents.<br>This type of functionality would depend on the
						user's environment.</li>
					<li>Make logical decisions on behalf of the user</li>
				</ul>

		<h3>PhishNet MVP functionality</h3>
		<img src="./images/phishing3.png">

		<p>
			<li>Users forward to or upload emails to PhishNet system and initialize analysis</li>

			<li>Any sensitive information like Personal Identifiable information is stripped from emails automatically
			</li>

			<li>PhishNet automatically checks if the sender is authentic by verifying SPF, DMARC, DKIM records against
				sender
				email address and will automatically classify email as suspicious if not verified</li>

			<li>PhishNet automatically checks sender address or domain, contained URLs and attachments against existing
				indicators already in the database and will automatically classify email as suspicious/malicious
				accordingly</li>

			<li>If threats not found in existing records, PhishNet checks external APIs by hash of file, URL address and
				if
				found, will automatically classify email as suspicious/malicious accordingly</li>

			<li>If threats not found in external intelligence records, scan URLs and attachments using toolkits and
				sandboxing
				and will automatically classify email as suspicious/malicious accordingly</li>

			<li>User can store and share the analysis report with other PhishNet users</li>

			<li>Users can query PhishNet analysis reports by means of searching and Dashboards</li>
