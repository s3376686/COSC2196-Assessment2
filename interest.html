                <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
                <p2>• What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</p2><br>
                <p3>My interest in IT is around learning coding languages and programming design and architecture. I
                    first learnt how to code starting with the C language and then went on to learn more about
                    polymorphism and design patterns with C++. I am currently learning more about back-end development
                    with C# and front-end development with react (a JavaScript library) while also learning about cloud
                    architecture and deployment with AWS (Amazon Web Services) technologies, such as their NoSQL
                    database, API gateway and container applications. My interest in IT started with building my own
                    desktop as a young teen and learning about web design with HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS
                    however I prefer to learn more about backend coding, diagnostics, and workload monitoring.
                <br><br>

                <p2>• Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if
                    any).</p2><br>
                I feel like the accessibility of cloud computing with companies such as AWS and Google and the
                    amount of information that can be accessed with sites such as W3, GitHub and even YouTube made it
                    easy to jump into IT and learn about full stack development. This degree would be my second
                    qualification outside of IT certificates and is intended to be used as an IT pathway as my work
                    experience is focused more on management.<br><br>

                <p2>• Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</p2><br>
                I felt like RMIT was globally recognised for its focus on innovation, technology research and
                    design. I was looking forward to expanding my knowledge on topics such as cloud computing and
                    machine learning with the help of some expert lecturers who have published some interesting articles
                    on these areas and continue to share their experience with students. As an Australian student living
                    away from campus it was also important to select an institution with a positive online experience.
                <br><br>

                <p2>• What do you expect to learn during your studies?</p2><br>
                I would hope to expand my coding and design architecture knowledge, learn to work within a team to
                    build multi-faceted design projects and to learn about IT topics such as security, networking, and
                    machine learning. It would be great to also learn about career pathways and further learnings
                    outside of the degree and network with students and teachers.</p3>
