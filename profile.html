                    • What do the results of these tests mean for you?
                </p2><br>
                <p3>It is important to be aware of the strengths and weaknesses that are highlighted in the tests and
                    what it means within a team dynamic. These tests could present the skills, positive behaviours, and
                    characteristics that I can provide a team to help achieve its goal while also being aware of the
                    weaknesses I may need to improve and where I would rely on other team members for help and
                    assistance.<br><br>

                    <p2>• How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</p2><br>
                    These results can provide a unique perspective and approach particularly when brainstorming ideas
                    with a team, communication and undertaking tasks. It can be important to understand strengths but
                    also weaknesses or faults to reduce risk, learn new behaviours and build cohesion with others to
                    maximise team performance.<br><br>

                    <p2>• How should you take this into account when forming a team?</p2><br>
                    This should be taken into account when forming a team to further bolster and improve on individual
                    strengths in order to excel and engage with the team at the highest potential, to have a team that
                    can absorb and deflect from individual weaknesses with their own unique strengths and to ensure a
                    diverse and multi-faceted range of different cultures and backgrounds that can be applied and shared
                    with the team so that all members can learn from other experiences and perspectives.
