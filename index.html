                        <td><p3>Hello and welcome to my IT profile. My name is Dave Martin, and I am currently studying
                            a
                            bachelor's
                            degree with RMIT. I am currently located in Canberra, Australia and have lived in this
                            country for
                            all my life. I come from an English-speaking background and my culture is closely tied
                            with
                            Australian traditions and customs. This will be my second tertiary education degree, my
                            first being
                            a Bachelor of Business Management and am hoping to cross into an IT career from
                            management.
                            Hobbies
                            include playing guitar and drums very badly, watching standup comedy, cricket and NRL
                            and
                            enjoy my
                            time off relaxing with friends and family. An interesting fact about me is that I am
                            currently
                            training for my very first triathlon which will be a fun challenge.</p3></td>
