        <h3>Hugo Ekert - s3376686</h3>

        <p>I'm based in Melbourne, and I started in IT as a manual software tester and I have gained valuable experience
            working within Scrum teams at various software companies. Primarily focusing on automated software testing,
            I have also ventured into software development, expanding my skills and knowledge. I enjoy the programming
            side of IT, especially in solving problems through automation and exploring new tools and frameworks.
            Outside of work my hobbies are playing Futsal and I like to review movies on Letterboxd.</p>

        <h2>David Martin - s3204581</h2>

        <p>Currently located in Canberra, Australia and have lived in this country for all my life.
            I come from an English-speaking background and my culture is closely tied with Australian traditions and
            customs.
            This will be my second tertiary education degree, my first being a Bachelor of Business Management and am
            hoping
            to cross into an IT career from a previous career in operations management. Hobbies include playing guitar
            and drums very badly,
            watching standup comedy, cricket and NRL and enjoy my time off relaxing with friends and family. An
            interesting fact about me
            is that I am currently training for my very first triathlon which will be a fun challenge. </p>

        <h3>Jake Harman - s3477973</h3>

        <p>My name is Jake and I’m a lifelong Melbournian. In the past I’ve started and stopped higher education, having
            begun both a Bachelor
            of Biomedical Science at La Trobe and a Bachelor of Design with RMIT. I'm employed with the government in a
            customer service role,
            and looking for a career change with a focus on IT. My initial interest in IT started over ten years ago
            when I built my first
            gaming PC, and most of my experience with IT has been through systems troubleshooting while working. Hobbies
            of mine outside gaming
            include playing guitar and recently trying to learn harmonica; much to the chagrin of my neighbours, I'm
            sure.

        <p>I live in Sydney and specialize in IT systems operations and security. My focus is application and network
            security and threat detection. Starting as a network administrator, I enjoyed fortune of being exposed to
            enterprise technology, later shifting focus on software development, and then eventually pivoting to
            information security. </p>
